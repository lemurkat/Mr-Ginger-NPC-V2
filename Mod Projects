I have so many ideas, I thought i'd write them down here so I don't forget them:

HIGHER PRIORITY:
Jasper: 
  Almost complete. Need to finalize heart events, tweak schedules and basically bug fix stuff. Most heart events written.
  Future Heart events to add:
  - Jasper is pestered into telling stories of the goblins by Jas and Vinny (Eloise too if East Scarpe installed). He agrees to teach them on Wednesdays. 
  (Dwarf is watching this somehow, if I can organize that?)
  FUTURE ADDITIONS: Add Cameron as an NPC, move them into East Scarpe. Jasper moves out of Archaeology House, and he and Cameron move in together.
Juliet:
- 14 heart event, still need ideas: current possiblities:
  - Charity concert to raise money for a rescue facility that takes abandoned dogs and trains them as emotional support animals.
  - it needs to show she is ready to reach out and connect with others on a deeper level. 
Gale (Jess):
 - Needs heart events: at least three.
  - one linking her to the witch? (Is the witch her sister?)
  - teaches farmer a little about plants: could this tie in somehow with one of the PPJA or MCN mods?
  - farmer finds her in the basement. She talks about the child she found and raised, and how hard it was to let him?/her? go.
  - could tie in with my plans to break the curse on Mr Ginger.
Mr Ginger:
  - unlock Tristan without requiring marriage to a cat.
    - Tristan will need to be set up as if he is a new NPC (dialogue, schedule etc), but would start at 10 hearts.
      - since Tristan WILL be datable, I'm not sure whether this would reset him down to 8 or not (as I triggered Mr Ginger's 10-heart event without dating him)
      - will need to build him a house: give him a room-mate? Could be entertaining!
      - alternate rival heart possibilities?
      - could write those scenes between he and Shane, maybe Marnie too.
    - Requires Jas to have reached 10-hearts and completed her Ranch Pack storyline. Mr Ginger at 10 hearts, Shane at 8 hearts.
    - How could we break the curse? 
    CON: Means I am making elaborate backstory for core characters and developing their story: defining Jas's parents, Marnie's backstory, etc. But it's not exactly compulsory, so does it matter?
Jacob and Eloise:
  - 3-5 heart events for Eloise:
    Ideas: her and the duck (in which she scolds the farmer for bread); discusses her friend Sora, and the war with Gotoro; finds two doves and takes them under her wing.
    Possibly helping her father out with something: a heart event that involves both of them would be pretty nifty.
    other ideas? 
  - 3-5 heart events for Jacob:
    Things to put in his heart events: 
      His relationship with Del/How he feels about raising Eloise as a solo dad.
      His duties around the valley.
      Could help him in the barn with his animals.
  - the two of them should involve something with the rock crabs harming the native fauna.

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
Sarah and Benjamin:
  - move into the valley in winter.
  - Ben was very ill as a child, leading to Sarah being somewhat over-protective. He spends a lot of time reading and playing video games. He has a fear of birds (possibly was attacked by a goose as a child).
  - Sarah loves cooking, and will open up her house to you and teach you to cook. She will teach you rotating recipes in exchange for ingredients (if I can work out how) and help you pick up any recipes you may have missed on Queen of Sauce.
  - Governor may visit occasionally. Their relationship seems sound. They are here because Sarah is concerned about Ben's health during the smog.
  - Eloise tries to befriend Ben, but is shocked at his fear of birds and views him as a bit of a coward. She coerces him into joining her in an "Expedition" (not sure where to, but that doesn't matter atm), during which she injures herself. He uses his first aid knowledge to help her.
  - And in the end, Eloise admits that he's not a coward (in fact, he's her new hero!), and proves to his mother that he can is no longer the sickly, weak child that she still thinks of him as.
Lily-Ann:
  - The "orchard ghost" storyline.

LOW PRIORITY:
Sea Monster:
  - lives under East Scarpe.
  - linked to Gale's storyline (above).
  - Plot not yet decided.
  - not datable.
Gwenny:
  - goblin princess, now estranged from her family. Came to East Scarpe after being exiled.
  - was engaged to Jasper (but has no romantic interest in him whatsoever).
  - not datable.
