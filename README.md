# Mr-Ginger-NPC-V2
V2 of my Stardew Valley mod. 

** Mr Ginger V2 is almost 100% complete and operative. Some aspects have not been fully tested (ie: divorce). The only reason it has not been uploaded to Nexus is due to my general lack of confidence in its reception.
(Also, some people think being able to marry the cat is weird, and I should hold off releasing it until the "room-mate" function can include Custom NPCs.) **

This contains the regular (released on Nexus) mod, plus the following additional features:
- Mr Ginger becomes datable after 6 hearts.
- You can dance with him at the flower dance.
- You can date and "marry" the char (the ceremony dialogue has been changed to make it a little less weird).
- At 14-hearts, the truth about Mr Ginger is revealed. This is configurable and can be toggled on and off if you don't like it - or just feel like seeing ALL the heart scenes!
- new 10 heart scene. Old 10-heart scene has been moved to configured 14-heart slot.
- additional dialogue from other chars.

Required to run it:
- Content Patcher (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
- TMXL (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1820)

Useful but not compulsory:
- Miss Coriel's Unique Courtship Dialogue (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3312)(makes bouquet acceptance less weird).
- Pregnancy role (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5762) (to remove any oddness that might ensue if you are a female farmer married to Mr Ginger).

To run it: unzip the file into your SDV "Mods" folder.
